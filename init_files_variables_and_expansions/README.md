This project teaches shell scripting fundamentals:
creating and using aliases
working with environment and local variable
understanding the PATH variable
performing arithmetic operations with shell expansions
converting between number bases, generating character combinations and using parameter expansions.
Each script demonstrates a specific shell concept in exactly two lines of code,
following strict formatting rules while avoiding prohibited commands like semicolons and logical operators.
