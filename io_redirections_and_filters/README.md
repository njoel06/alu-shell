# Shell - IO Redirections and Filters

## Project Overview
This project focuses on mastering **shell input/output redirections** and **filtering techniques** in Bash. The goal is to create 27 shell scripts that demonstrate various file operations, text processing, and command-line utilities while adhering to strict formatting requirements.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I will:
- Understand and implement I/O redirections in shell scripting
- Master text processing commands (grep, cut, sort, uniq, tr, etc.)
- Learn to manipulate files and directories efficiently
- Practice working with system files and logs
- Develop scripts that follow strict formatting guidelines

## Project Requirements
- **Environment**: All scripts must run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Script Format**: Each script must be exactly two lines long
- **Shebang**: First line must be `#!/bin/bash`
- **Newline**: All files must end with a newline character
- **Restrictions**: No use of backticks, `&&`, `||`, `;`, `sed`, or `awk`
- **Permissions**: All files must be executable

## Task Breakdown

### Part 1: Basic Output and File Operations
- Create scripts for basic output and file display
- Work with standard Unix files (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts)
- Practice with head, tail, and cat commands

### Part 2: File Manipulation
- Create and manipulate files with special names
- Implement file duplication and directory state saving
- Work with file extensions and directory structures

### Part 3: Text Processing
- Implement grep operations with various flags
- Practice text transformation with tr command
- Work with sorting and unique filtering

### Part 4: Advanced Operations
- Parse system files and logs
- Implement complex find operations
- Create scripts for specific file type operations

### Part 5: Data Analysis
- Analyze web server logs
- Process and filter large datasets
- Implement counting and sorting algorithms

## Skills to Demonstrate
1. **Shell Scripting**: Writing clean, efficient Bash scripts
2. **File I/O**: Mastering input/output redirections
3. **Text Processing**: Using grep, cut, sort, uniq effectively
4. **System Navigation**: Working with system files and directories
5. **Problem Solving**: Creating solutions with constraint programming

## Technical Constraints
- Each solution must be implemented in exactly two lines
- Scripts must handle edge cases and specific requirements
- No use of prohibited operators or commands
- All scripts must be thoroughly tested
