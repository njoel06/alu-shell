This project involves learning bash scripting fundamentals focused on loops, conditional statements, and text parsing techniques. Each script follows strict formatting rules including a specific shebang line, mandatory explanatory comments, and must pass automated quality checks using Shellcheck. The exercises build proficiency in control flow, pattern matching, and text manipulation while adhering to best practices for writing robust, maintainable shell scripts that execute efficiently in Ubuntu environments.
